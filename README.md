# Paketin Seuranta

Nitramite Paketin Seuranta on pitkän historian omaava eri kuriirien toimitusten seuraamiseen 
tarkoitettu Android sovellus. Sovelluksen kohdeyleisö on Suomessa mutta pidetään repo 
yleisesti Englannin kielellä.

Paketin Seuranta is free application, no ads or paid content ever!

You are not allowed to copy or use this app code to create similar application to 
distribute it on Google Play or any other store.

### Help required

I am looking for help to develop this application further. If you are interested let me know,
contact me via email: nitramite@outlook.com

Development areas are: bug fixes, user interface, more tracking methods, better cleaner code and basic maintenance. Somebody with material design ui experience is especially welcome!

### For participants
1. Let's keep Paketin Seuranta simple and respect privacy. No private servers and stuff like that. 
Only direct communication to parcel service provider apis.

2. I [norkator](https://github.com/norkator) will review and test pull requests. If everything looks and works 
according to rules pr will be merged. Otherwise I ask changes. Just give me time. This repo is not dead. 


## Versioning
Currently I just increment build number and version number itself doesn't have any logic in it.
Maybe in the future will use Semver or similar. Not mandatory yet because haven't have need for breaking changes.
